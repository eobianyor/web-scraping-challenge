# web-scraping-challenge
A web-scraping project to collect web data on a selected topic and create a flask app to view the data
We well create a function to browse and collect some web data of some website on a selected topic (in the case; News from NASA on Mars) 
Then store the data in a non-sql database, and create a flask app to render the data on a webpage.
